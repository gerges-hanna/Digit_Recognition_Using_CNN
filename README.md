# Digit_Recognition_Using_CNN (MNIST DATA) - PYTHON

in this project, I need to make a program to predict the digit from the handwritten image.
I am using mnist data to get (60000) image training and (10000) image test.


## Project Contnet
#### 1-DigitModelCNN.py
This is a Class file it contains all functions I need to make a model, prepare data, plot data, get accuracy & loss, plot the history of training, save & load the model and predict the input data.

#### 2-CreateModel.py
In this file, I use all function in DigitModelCNN.py class to handle the data, create & save the model  

#### 3-main.py
Here I load the model from my pc and take the input data from the user and return the prediction of this input and plot is based on my model
